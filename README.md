This application simulates a packet Sender / Receiver over a Channel which replicates a medium such as a copper 
cable where bit errors can be introduced and packets may be lost or dropped as in real life. 

The program can be run through a Terminal window as follows (in three seperate windows):
python3 channel.py {specify port numbers to use}
python3 sender.py {specify port numbers to use}
python3 receiver.py {specify port number to use}
